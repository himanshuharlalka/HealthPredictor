The purpose of Health Predictor is to make technology more useful in solving problematic healthcare challenges and by using this technology we can interpret data which is obtained by diagnosing various symptoms, analyzing data, and then predict the diseases. Through this project, we aspire to enhance public health by providing a system in their pocket that can diagnose the diseases and give recommendations. The current lifestyle of humans has seen a drastic change over the past few years. Eating habits and evolution of technology have played a major role in the same. Keeping this in mind we have chosen Myopia, Colour Blindness, Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome / Disease (PCOS / PCOD) and Probability of Heart Attack to implement in our health app to create more awareness about the above health disorders.

In the flutter application we are catering to mainly detect eye ailments, specifically Myopia and Color Blindness.
